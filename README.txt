## Built for Honours Capstone at Southwest Baptist University
### Building the Project
To run the project, you must have SBT and Java installed.

Once you do, navigate to the root directory and run `sbt compile` to run the project.

Running `sbt assembly` will create a fat jar with all required dependencies (including Scala) that can be run standalone.

Alternatively, using `sbt run` will also run the project.

### Using the Project
Follow the prompts to run the project. Make sure your hardware is decent, as the iterations required and the state size can potentially become massive.
